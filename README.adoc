Darwinia is a bridge blockchain connecting different chains using darwinia relay and can be connected to Polkadot network as a parachain.

As an open cross-chain bridge protocol based on Substrate, Darwinia focuses on the construction of future Internet of Tokens, including decentralized tokens swap, exchange, and market.

== Architecture

It could have two models, the Solo model and the Polkadot model. For more details, go to https://github.com/darwinia-network/rfcs/blob/master/RFC/zh_CN/0007-dawinia-token-staking-model.md#solo%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F[RFC-0007].

== Road Map

Darwinia Network is composed of Darwinia Bridge Chain(Darwinia), and a series of other blockchains bridged to Darwinia, including public blockchains such as Ethereum, Tron, EOS, and application specific blockchains.

Darwinia Bridge Chain will provide interoperability for cross-chain tokens using Darwinia's bridge relay innovation and decentralized backing technology.

Crab Network is a canary network for Darwinia, Darwinia's new cutting edge technologies will be first deployed on Crab Network.

== Building

=== Hacking on Darwinia

If you'd actually like to hack on Darwinia, you can just grab the source code and
build it. We also provide the script to help you setup your developing environment in bellow sections.
Please ensure you have Rust and the support software installed:

==== Linux and Mac

For Unix-based operating systems, you should run the following commands:

[source, shell]
----
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

rustup default nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
----

You will also need to install the following packages:

 - Linux:
[source, shell]
sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git clang libclang-dev

- Linux on ARM:
`rust-lld` is required for linking wasm, but is missing on non Tier 1 platforms.
So, use this https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume/blob/master/script/wasm-deps.sh[script]
to build `lld` and create the symlink `/usr/bin/rust-lld` to the build binary.

 - Mac:
[source, shell]
brew install cmake pkg-config openssl git llvm

To finish installation of Darwinia, jump down to <<shared-steps,shared steps>>.

==== Windows

If you are trying to set up Darwinia on Windows, you should do the following:

1. First, you will need to download and install "Build Tools for Visual Studio:"

    * You can get it at this link: https://aka.ms/buildtools
    * Run the installation file: `vs_buildtools.exe`
    * Please ensure the Windows 10 SDK component is included when installing the Visual C++ Build Tools.
    * image:https://i.imgur.com/zayVLmu.png[image]
    * Restart your computer.

2. Next, you need to install Rust:

    * Detailed instructions are provided by the https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#installing-rustup-on-windows[Rust Book].
        * Download from: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
        * Run the installation file: `rustup-init.exe`
        > Note that it should not prompt you to install vs_buildtools since you did it in step 1.
        * Choose "Default Installation."
        * To get started, you need Cargo's bin directory (%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin) in your PATH environment variable. Future applications will automatically have the correct environment, but you may need to restart your current shell.

3. Then, you will need to run some commands in CMD to set up your Wasm Build Environment:

	rustup default nightly
	rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

4. Then, you need to install LLVM: https://releases.llvm.org/download.html

5. Next, you need to install OpenSSL, which we will do with `vcpkg`:

	mkdir \Tools
	cd \Tools
	git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
	cd vcpkg
	.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
	.\vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows-static

6. After, you need to add OpenSSL to your System Variables. Note that in order for the following commands to work, you need to use Windows Powershell:

	$env:OPENSSL_DIR = 'C:\Tools\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows-static'
	$env:OPENSSL_STATIC = 'Yes'
	[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENSSL_DIR', $env:OPENSSL_DIR, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
	[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENSSL_STATIC', $env:OPENSSL_STATIC, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)

7. Finally, you need to install `cmake`: https://cmake.org/download/

==== Shared Steps

Then, grab the Darwinia source code:

[source, shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia.git
cd darwinia
----

Then build the code:

[source, shell]
----
cargo build                 # Builds all native code
----

You can run all the tests if you like:

[source, shell]
cargo test --all

Or just run the tests of a specific package (i.e. `cargo test -p darwinia-staking`)

You can start a development chain with:

[source, shell]
cargo run --release -- --dev

Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set: `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run --release \-- --dev`.

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a local testnet with two validator nodes for Alice and Bob, who are the initial authorities of the genesis chain specification that have been endowed with a testnet Ring.

We'll start Alice's Darwinia node first with her chain database stored locally at `/tmp/darwinia-develop/alice`:

[source, shell]
cargo run --release \-- \
  --alice \
  --rpc-external \
  --rpc-port 23333 \
  --ws-external \
  --ws-port 23334 \
  --rpc-cors all \
  --port 23335 \
  --base-path /tmp/darwinia-develop/alice

Or just:

[source, shell]
cargo run --release -- --alice --conf=boot-conf/develop/alice.json

In the second terminal, we'll run the following to start Bob's Darwinia node on a different TCP port, and with his chain database stored locally at `/tmp/darwinia-develop/bob`:

[source, shell]
cargo run --release \-- \
  --bob \
  --rpc-external \
  --rpc-port 23336 \
  --ws-external \
  --ws-port 23337 \
  --rpc-cors all \
  --port 23338 \
  --base-path /tmp/darwinia-develop/bob

Or just:

[source, shell]
cargo run --release -- --bob --conf=boot-conf/develop/bob.json

Additional Darwinia CLI usage options are available and may be shown by running `cargo run --release -- --help`.

=== WASM binaries

The WASM binaries are built during the normal `cargo build` process. To control the WASM binary building,
we support multiple environment variables:

* `SKIP_WASM_BUILD` - Skips building any WASM binary. This is useful when only native should be recompiled.
* `BUILD_DUMMY_WASM_BINARY` - Builds dummy WASM binaries. These dummy binaries are empty and useful
                              for `cargo check` runs.
* `WASM_BUILD_TYPE` - Sets the build type for building WASM binaries. Supported values are `release` or `debug`.
                      By default the build type is equal to the build type used by the main build.
* `TRIGGER_WASM_BUILD` - Can be set to trigger a WASM build. On subsequent calls the value of the variable
                         needs to change. As WASM builder instructs `cargo` to watch for file changes
                         this environment variable should only be required in certain circumstances.
* `WASM_TARGET_DIRECTORY` - Will copy any build WASM binary to the given directory. The path needs
                            to be absolute.
* `WASM_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS` - Extend `RUSTFLAGS` given to `cargo build` while building the wasm binary.
* `WASM_BUILD_NO_COLOR` - Disable color output of the wasm build.

Each project can be skipped individually by using the environment variable `SKIP_PROJECT_NAME_WASM_BUILD`.
Where `PROJECT_NAME` needs to be replaced by the name of the cargo project, e.g. `node-runtime` will
be `NODE_RUNTIME`.

=== Precautions

If you run into problems when building this project,
please kindly check following things before making an issue.

* using the latest nightly Rust
* build without `sccache`

== Key management

Keys in Darwinia are stored in the keystore in the file system. To store keys into this keystore,
you need to use one of the two provided RPC calls. If your keys are encrypted or should be encrypted
by the keystore, you need to provide the key using one of the CLI arguments `--password`,
`--password-interactive`, or `--password-filename`.

=== Recommended RPC call

For most users who want to run a validator node, the `author_rotateKeys` RPC call is sufficient.
The RPC call will generate `N` Session keys for you and return their public keys. `N` is the number
of session keys configured in the runtime. The output of the RPC call can be used as input for the
`session::set_keys` transaction.

```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"author_rotateKeys", "id":1 }' localhost:9933
```

=== Advanced RPC call

If the Session keys need to match a fixed seed, they can be set individually key by key. The RPC call
expects the key seed and the key type. The key types supported by default in Darwinia are listed
https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/core/primitives/src/crypto.rs#L767[here], but the
user can declare any key type.

```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"author_insertKey", "params":["KEY_TYPE", "SEED", "PUBLIC"],"id":1 }' localhost:9933
```

`KEY_TYPE` - needs to be replaced with the 4-character key type identifier.
`SEED` - is the seed of the key.
`PUBLIC` - public key for the given key.

== Documentation

=== Viewing documentation for Darwinia packages

You can generate the documentation for a Darwinia Rust package and have it automatically open in your web browser using https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html#using-rustdoc-with-cargo[rustdoc with Cargo],
(of the The Rustdoc Book), by running the following command:

```
cargo doc --open
```

If you just want to generate the document from specific package, you may use the following command:

```
cargo doc --package <spec> --open
```

And replace `<spec>` with one of the following (i.e. `cargo doc --package darwinia-cli --open`):

* Darwinia Core
[source, shell]
darwinia-cli, ethash, fly-client,
merkle-mountain-range, merkle-patricia-trie, eth-primitives
* Darwinia Runtime Pallet Library
[source, shell]
darwinia-balances, darwinia-eth-backing, darwinia-eth-relay,
darwinia-staking, darwinia-support
* Node
[source, shell]
node-cli, node-primitives, node-runtime

== Contributing

=== Environment

The `scripts/bootstrap.sh` helps set up your development environment.
The nightly `Rust`, `cargo`, `rustfmt` will be installed,
the git hooks will be set, and ready to code.

Besides, the script will install some essential packages depends on your OS,
if you want to do it manually, use the `--fast` option to skip.
We will appreciate your contribution.
